<p>Junior designers shouldn&#39;t care about business and functionality of their designs.</p>
<p>This goes against what LinkedIn design gurus preach. Let me explain why, but first, look at the photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a1c921a-1c41-431a-a716-ffd1e828752a/f777b77a-ae15-4e42-a8fa-ca5e164b2eed/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45FSPPWI6X%2F20241207%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20241207T202217Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d454b2bd4d89320167e886adc0461ba494740010ed93f567b5405e2ef1040d95&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Whenever you see such structures, you can safely guess you are passing by some arts or design school, and indeed it is one. It&#39;s the ground nearby the</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/school-of-art-design-and-architecture/">School of Art, Design and Architecture - NUST</a></p>
<p>, and the engineer in me at first tried to make sense of it and thought what&#39;s the function of them, can they even hold my weight? When you ask the students who made such, they probably would have a good story behind it. Some story of sustainability, organic materials, nature-inspired forms, or giving tribute to local artisans or something like that.</p>
<p>A critic would dismiss their story, and some designers would even laugh. But what they are doing is something no less than magic: they are transforming materials into a shape only to be constrained by physics. The final form is unpredictable. Bamboo sticks, once cylindrical, become a large, stable non-cylindrical structure.</p>
<p>These exercises might not help them win business, but it will help them develop a great deal of intuition about working with available materials, forming connections, transforming small components into larger structures, testing out the limitations and bounds, and more importantly, experiencing the joy of unhinged creativity and pouring in the efforts to see something come out of it which will be noticed by others.</p>
<p>Imagine what would have happened if a senior architect or an engineer had handed them a blueprint to follow to build something functional. Sure, these bamboo sticks would have transformed into a shade to stand beneath or a bench to sit on, but in the end, you would have solved the short-term problem of making a usable product but deprived the future of talented designers who would be making even better products that deals with the materials of the future. You&#39;d have people who are good at following instructions, are afraid to make mistakes, and can&#39;t rely on intuition to solve problems. Hence, stifling the innovation.</p>
<p>When we discourage junior or aspiring product designers from making non-functional designs, we hurt their creativity and confidence to express themselves. Eventually, you will have designs that are risk-averse and an average of Mobbin screens.</p>
<p>Junior designers are like these students; our expectations should match.</p>
<p>Who will do the design that functions? Those designs are not built in a silo; they are translations of engineering and business requirements. When those designers will go into such cross-functional environments, they will eventually figure it out, just like you and I did. Our job as seniors is to help them with that translation, not to tell them to skip the steps and jump straight to learning translation. LLMs would become better at this translation layer soon, what would be rare is creativity and guts to innovate.</p>

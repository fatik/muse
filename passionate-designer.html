<p>Remember the time when every UI/UX designer on earth wrote &quot;Hey I am a passionate multidisciplinary designer...&quot; on their portfolios and CV? Yeah, that became kind of a meme. But here&#39;s the thing - digital product design really is a field of passion more than whatever skills you happen to have at the moment. (Quick disclaimer though: don&#39;t use this as an excuse to be lazy about upskilling. What I really mean is that constant adaptation and upskilling is required just to survive, and one can only keep doing that if they&#39;re actually passionate about it.)</p>
<p>Truth is, the bar to get into this field was pretty low back then. But thriving in it? That&#39;s where you&#39;d have the toughest time because you&#39;d be competing with people driven purely by passion. It&#39;s like those other &quot;passion fields&quot; - being a chef, acting, music, arts... you know, the ones career counselors tell you to stay away from if you want an easy and stable life.</p>
<p>The hiring scene was wild. Whether it was Google or some tiny startup, the requirement was always more about passion than skills. Hiring managers honestly didn&#39;t even know what they wanted. Should they hire someone who could build webpages? Someone who does graphic design? Someone with an HCI degree? And let&#39;s be real - designers themselves didn&#39;t know what they were doing either. It was all brute force learning.</p>
<p>Then design thinking showed up, trying to make sense of all this chaos. But it failed miserably because - plot twist - whatever the designers were doing, they were actually doing it right all along. They were doing whatever it took to absorb the ambiguity from projects. The real problem? They just weren&#39;t great at explaining it, or they were doubting themselves too much thanks to all these &quot;thought leaders&quot; insisting that real design only happens when you&#39;re surrounded by sticky notes.</p>
<p>The productization era changed everything though. Suddenly there were more products and startups than people who actually had passion for design. But hey, UX courses and bootcamps saved the day! They gave us the supply of much-needed designers who might not be passionate enough but are at least motivated by the glamour and salary of being a designer. And you know what? That&#39;s actually cool. It created an equilibrium in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>What&#39;s not cool is how much this has masked reality. Every organization now thinks they can get a seasoned designer just by posting a job and getting 500 applications. And then they either end up ranting about not finding anyone &quot;suitable&quot; or they start flexing about these numbers and giving advice about how all those rejected candidates could &quot;improve.&quot;</p>
<p>But here&#39;s what they&#39;re missing - those seasoned professionals they&#39;re trying to hire now? They were hired years ago based on their passion, not their perfect portfolios or some take-home assignment. The people who hired them saw their drive and curiosity and let the rest take care of itself.</p>
<p>Sure, having tons of applicants might make you feel like you&#39;re in a position to pick someone who can deliver results right away. If you&#39;re lucky, maybe you&#39;ll snag your ideal designer with exceptional compensation or by really matching their values. But reality check - hire someone who shows both passion and skills, and things will probably work out better.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t me asking organizations to lower their expectations. This is just reality. The sooner we all accept it, the better off we&#39;ll be.</p>
